I relocated from Seattle to Minneapolis, and currently teach and work out of FOCI Center for Glass Arts. I still consider myself quite a novice in neon, but I am getting better every day and hope to push myself as far as I can go&#x21;</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">ADDRESS1</td>\n                <td class=\"user\">4700 Blaisdell Ave</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">ADDRESS2</td>\n                <td class=\"user\"></td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">CITY</td>\n                <td class=\"user\">Minneapolis</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">REGION</td>\n                <td class=\"user\">MN</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">POSTAL</td>\n                <td class=\"user\">55419</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">COUNTRY</td>\n                <td class=\"user\">US</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">PROMO</td>\n                <td class=\"user\">Medium &#x28;38-40&#x29;</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td class=\"key\">G-RECAPTCHA-RESPONSE</td>\n                <td class=\"user\">Success&#x3a; 0.9</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr><td class=\"key\"><br /></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n              <tr><td class=\"key\">Referrer</td><td>https://neonmakersguild.org/join</td></tr>\n              <tr><td class=\"key\">IP</td><td>70.59.114.170</td></tr>\n              <tr><td class=\"key\">Time</td><td>Wed, Feb 19, 2025 @ 09:42 CST</td></tr>\n            </table>\n          </body>\n        </html>"}
