Another technique he used to impress was the stick-trick, a fast roll performed by slapping two drumsticks together in a circular motion using \"taps\" or single-stroke stickings. He often used contrasting techniques to keep long drum solos from getting mundane. Aside from his energetic, explosive displays, he would go into quieter passages. One passage he would use in most solos started with a simple single-stroke roll on the&nbsp;<a title=\"Snare drum\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum\">snare drum</a>&nbsp;picking up speed and power, then slowly moving his sticks closer to the rim as he got quieter, and eventually playing on the rim itself while still maintaining speed.

Listening to someone play the guitar is the very last thing I want to do right now!\" But he kept insisting and he ended up playing the record for me.

In an interview with&nbsp;<em><a title=\"Guitar World\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_World\">Guitar World</a></em>&nbsp;magazine, he was asked if he was \"ever tempted to switch to right-handed playing.\" Iommi responded:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>If I knew what I know now I probably would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, and it seemed like I had been playing a long time. I thought I&rsquo;d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn\'t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent the same amount of time learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn\'t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tony_Iommi_Interview_Outtakes,_Guitar_World_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-Tony_Iommi_Interview_Outtakes,_Guitar_World-19\">[19]</a></sup></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>He ultimately decided to continue playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old&nbsp;<a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Fairy Liquid\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Liquid\">Fairy Liquid</a>&nbsp;bottle &ndash; \"melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger\" &ndash; and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Woods_16-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-Woods-16\">[16]</a></sup>&nbsp;which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. Second, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge&nbsp;<a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Guitar strings\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_strings#Gauge\">guitar strings</a>&nbsp;to make it easier to do so.<sup id=\"cite_ref-kitts_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-kitts-20\">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used&nbsp;<a title=\"Banjo\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo\">banjo</a>&nbsp;strings instead, until around 1970&ndash;71 when&nbsp;<a title=\"Picato Musician Strings\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picato_Musician_Strings\">Picato Strings</a>&nbsp;began making light-gauge guitar strings.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEIommi201225&ndash;27_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIommi201225%E2%80%9327-21\">[21]</a></sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEIommi201224_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIommi201224-22\">[22]</a></sup>&nbsp;In 1974, Iommi told&nbsp;<a title=\"Guitar Player\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Player\"><em>Guitar Player</em>&nbsp;magazine</a>&nbsp;that the thimbles \"helped with his technique\" because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-23\">[23]</a></sup>&nbsp;Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as&nbsp;<a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"D- tuning\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%E2%99%AD_tuning\">three</a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Semitone\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone\">semitones</a>&nbsp;below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on \"Children of the Grave\", \"Lord of this World\", and \"Into the Void\", all on the album&nbsp;<em><a title=\"Master of Reality\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Reality\">Master of Reality</a></em>). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a \"bigger, heavier sound\", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEIommi201294_24-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIommi201294-24\">[24]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Iommi reflected in 2016 saying that his greatest regret is losing his fingertips.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>It became a burden. Some people believe the accident invented heavy metal. It helped me invent a new kind of music. I play a new sound and a different style of playing, and a different sort of music. Really, it turned out to be a good thing off a bad thing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-25\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></sup>&nbsp;But I don\'t know whether it did.
